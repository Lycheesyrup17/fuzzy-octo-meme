# SpaceX First Launch Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis project to determine factors influencing SpaceX's first launch data. It includes data collection, processing, and predictive modeling as part of the Data Science Coursera IBM project.

## Objectives
- Collect and process data related to SpaceX launches
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify potential influencing factors
- Develop predictive models to determine key factors affecting the first launch date
- Visualize findings and present insights

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models

## Repository Structure
- `EDA Using Pandas and Matplotlib.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook
- `Presentation Report_DataScience Capstone_Coursera_Abdul Ibrahim.pdf`: Full Presentation report 
- `Interactive Visual Launch Sites Locations Map ...`: Interactive visualization of launch sites
- `SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb`: Machine learning prediction notebook
- `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqlite.ipynb`: SQL-based exploratory data analysis
- `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb`: Data collection using API
- `jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb`: Web scraping notebook
- `labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb`: Data wrangling processes
- `spacex_dash_app.py`: Dash application for interactive data exploration

## Key Findings
- The success rate increased significantly, reaching over 100% by 2020. This demostrates SpaceX's improving technology and experience over time
- All four classification models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors) achieved the same accuracy of 83.33% on the test set. This suggests that the problem may be equally well-suited to various classification approaches.
